I was made aware of Wireshark when I wanted to investigate certain HTTP requests to Elasticsearch. Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer with a GUI, while TShark is the equivalent CLI tool.

TShark has a lot of options and capabilities to get low-level network insights but what I wanted to do was pretty specific and simple: I wanted to intercept and monitor HTTP requests to a certain port on localhost.

`tshark` lets you do that, without the need to set up a proxy, which would be how I normally do this sort of thing.

As an example let's start a server locally:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

Let's send a request:

    $ curl localhost:8000/hey
    <head>
    <title>Error response</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1>Error response</h1>
    <p>Error code 404.
    <p>Message: File not found.
    <p>Error code explanation: 404 = Nothing matches the given URI.
    </body>

It fails, as expected. With `tshark` you can monitor HTTP requests to port 8000 like this:

    $ tshark -i lo0 -Y http.request 'tcp port 8000'
    Capturing on 'Loopback: lo0'
    5   0.000132    127.0.0.1 â†’ 127.0.0.1    HTTP 137 GET /hey HTTP/1.1

Here's how you can customize which HTTP data you see:

    $ # Going to run curl -X POST localhost:8000/hey -d '{ "yo": true }' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' from another terminal
    $ tshark -i lo0 -Y http.request -T fields -e http.request.method -e http.request.uri -e http.file_data 'tcp port 8000'
    Capturing on 'Loopback: lo0'
    POST	/hey	{ "yo": true }

If you want to see the request headers and body, you can get most of that data with the `-O http,json` option:

    $ # Going to run curl -X POST localhost:8000/hey -d '{ "yo": true }' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' from another terminal
    $ tshark -i lo0 -Y http.request -O http,json 'tcp port 8000'
    Capturing on 'Loopback: lo0'
