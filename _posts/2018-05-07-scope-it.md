For multi-tenant applications you should remember to scope associations.

Here's an example to highlight potential scoping issues. Let's consider the following simple domain model:

```ruby
class Account < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :categories
  has_many :posts
  # Defines an account (tenant).
  # ...
end

class Category < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :account
  # An account has a predefined set of categories each post can have.
end

class Post < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :account
  belongs_to :author, class_name: "User"
  belongs_to :category
  # ...
end
```

When a user has to create post we will need to let the user choose the category from `current_account.categories` - but it can easily be forgotten that the submitted field `post[category_id]` should also be whitelisted at the model-level.

This problem can be solved in multiple ways.

## 1) Controller-level whitelisting

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @post = current_account.posts.new(post_params)
    @post.category = current_account.categories.find(@post.category_id) if @post.category_id

    if @post.save
      redirect_to root_url
    else
      render :new
    end
  end

  private

  def post_params
    params.fetch(:post, {}).permit(
      :title,
      # + some other fields
      :category_id,
    )
  end
end
```

## 2) Model-level whitelisting

The cleaner approach would be to move the white-listing to the model.

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  before_validation :whitelist_category!

  # ...

  private

  def whitelist_category!
    self.category =
      if account && category_id
        account.categories.find(category_id)
      end
  end
end
```

## Damage?

This vulnerability could in this specific example lead to one account showing the posts of another account *if* the posts are looked up via the category which is not a totally unreasonable thing you would do.

## Conclusion

No matter the approach, we should remember to do this type of whitelisting when we let users set-up associations.
